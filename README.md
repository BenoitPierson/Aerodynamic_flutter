* OBJECTIVE : 
	- Modelling the flutter phenomenon for aircraft in MATLAB
	- Flutter is an aerodynamic instability appearing with modes coupling for some specific wind speeds

* ASSUMPTIONS :
	- 2 modes are considered : 1 bending mode & 1 torsion mode (2 modal degrees of freedom in total) --> Only one possible coupling 
	- The aerodynamic loads are linearized around the balance position 

* REMARKS :
	- We will find further videos and theoretical explanations about this phenomenon on the internet and youtube
